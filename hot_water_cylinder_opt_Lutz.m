%   Comment: Optimiser for various models of hot water cylinders.
%   
%   In addition to any assumptions in Appendix E; the following assumptions are
%   made about the cylinder construction:
%   * inner cylinder walls are of negligible thickness compared to the
%   * insulation;
%   * inner and outer cylinder wall thermal resistance is negligible
%     compared to the insulation;
%   * cylinder insulation is the same in all parts of the cylinder;
%   * cylinder bottom is insulated with the same material as the top and side;
%   * insulation thickness at the top and bottom of the cylinder is equal;
%   * one element only in the cylinder;
%   * two pipe connections are present that are not insulated;
%   * heat losses occur from cold connection the same as for the hot connection;
%   * TPR valve is present and not insulated;
%   * thermostat pocket has an effective diameter of 35 mm;
%   * temperature rise above ambient is 55 K;
%   * cylinder exterior walls are held at a constant temperature of 20?C;
%   * cylinder insulation is polyurethane with a bulk thermal conductivity of
%     0.025 W.m-1.K-1.
